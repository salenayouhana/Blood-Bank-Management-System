# Blood-Bank-Management-System
INITIALIZING STEPS
To start our database program, you will need mySQL Workbench installed and the local server must be created. The database is called blood_bank_database. You will need the following information for it to run.
Hostname: localhost
Port: 3306
Username: my_app
Password: test
You will then need to run the .sql files bloodbank.sql and bloodinfo.sql provided. You will need to run it on the local server for the web page to run correctly.

Then you can open up our program through Visual Studio Code.
You can download the code from github or download the zip which is called bloodbank.zip. The zip file has all the files needed to run the website. Index.php is the starting page.
To run the localhost you would use the command 
  php -S localhost:8000
